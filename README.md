Google foo.bar
==============
As the old saying goes, if you don't know something, google it...
There's a lot of talk lately about a new secretive way of recruiting programmers for google.
By harnessing their flagship product, google search, they can weed out engineers from the rest based on keywords and interest.

And then, when the stars align ( In my case searching global lock for go garbage collector did it this time), you get warped into commander lambda's world to save the bunnies... 

TL:DR! click on the levels to see the challenges

Welcome to foobar version 54-16-gb0c36ad4-beta (2018-04-19-20:45+0000)



Google has a code challenge ready for you.

Been here before? Log in



This invitation will expire if you close this page.

Success! You've managed to infiltrate Commander Lambda's evil organization, and finally earned yourself an entry-level position as a Minion on her space station. From here, you just might be able to subvert her plans to use the LAMBCHOP doomsday device to destroy Bunny Planet. Problem is, Minions are the lowest of the low in the Lambda hierarchy. Better buck up and get working, or you'll never make it to the top...

For a list of commands type help. To get started with your first challenge type request.
